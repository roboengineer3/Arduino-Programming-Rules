1. Void is a command which with the help of we declare function in arduino programming.

i.e. we use function Setup and loop

so we declare as void setup and void loop.

and you can also make function with the help of void command

and every function after () open or close brackt should be

after that when our function has started then there will be { curly backet and after when our function is going to close then there will be } close curly backet 

so arduino ide will understand from this point our function has started and this point my function has complete.

RULES:

1. Every Arduino Program has void setup() and void loop().

2. Program runs in linear fashion.

3. Remember the {} Curly Brackets.

4. Program is Case sensitive

5. Use // to add comments in Program.

6. /* ... */ notation is used to write multi-line comments in the code. 
Comments are pieces of text that are ignored by the compiler and are used to explain the code for better readability and maintenance.

When to Use:
Documentation: To explain the purpose of a block of code or the entire program.
Code Maintenance: To make the code easier for others (or yourself) to understand later.
Debugging: Temporarily disable a block of code without deleting it.

7. Put ; after every statement
